<p><img src="/images/posts/pedal_tinkering_illustration.png" alt="PedalBored Concept"></p>
<p>Guitar pedals transform signals in unpredictable and rewarding ways - could we do the same with lyrics? This idea occurred to me about 6 years ago when implementing a Naive Bayes classifier for text classification during my first computational statistics course. I said I would circle back -- well here I am.</p>
<p>Back.</p>
<p>Now I'm using large-scale transformer architectures instead of simple probabilistic models. And now I can just let Claude Code do simple development tasks in the background while I do laundry etc.</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p><img src="/images/posts/pedalbored_flow_diagram.svg" alt="PedalBored Flow Diagram"></p>
<p><strong>Light Distortion</strong> applies sequential machine translation across multiple target languages. Each language exhibits distinct semantic constraints and syntactic structures, inducing gradual semantic drift with each translation step. Like running audio through a chain of signal processors.</p>
<p><strong>Heavy Distortion</strong> first performs translation to a target language, then applies masked language modeling in that linguistic context, forcing the transformer to perform contextual inference within non-English semantic space. The text then continues through additional translation hops, accumulating both translation artifacts and language-specific idiomatic influences.</p>
<h2>Example 1: Kitchen Light</h2>
<p>A transformer model generated a simple test text exploring themes of domestic transgression</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Original</th>
    <th>Light Distortion</th>
    <th>Heavy Distortion</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Kitchen light spills yellow into the night<br>
      The freezer door hangs open wide<br>
      These small rebellions I've designed
    </td>
    <td>
      The kitchen is flooded with yellow light at night.<br>
      The door of the freezer has been left open.<br>
      My small act of resistance.
    </td>
    <td>
      The warm yellow glow of the kitchen light.<br>
      The freezer door remains wide open.<br>
      Those foods I have forgotten.
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The semantic drift is evident: "small rebellions I've designed" undergoes lexical formalization to "small act of resistance" (maintaining semantic coherence), then experiences complete conceptual divergence to "foods I have forgotten" (preserving only the spatial context while losing intentionality).</p>
<h2>Example 2: Like a Rolling Stone (Verse 1)</h2>
<p>Dylan's classic opening verse, increasingly scrambled.</p>
<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Original</th>
    <th>Light Distortion</th>
    <th>Heavy Distortion</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      Once upon a time you dressed so fine<br>
      Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?<br>
      ...<br>
      Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone
    </td>
    <td>
      You used to be very chic, didn't you?<br>
      At the peak of your time, you even threw 10 cents to beggars...<br>
      Like a stranger, like a rolling stone
    </td>
    <td>
      You were once so well dressed<br>
      You gave a ten-franc piece to the beggars...<br>
      Like a boat without a rudder, like a rolling leaf
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>My favorite transformation: "like a rolling stone" â†’ "like a boat without a rudder, like a rolling leaf". The cascaded translation process generated novel metaphorical constructions that preserve the semantic essence of directionless motion while introducing a different idiom that has some fresh potential.</p>

<h2>Is This Useful?</h2>
<p>Probably not. But neither are my 4 delay pedals. Sometimes you need your words to undergo a stochastic transformation through some GPUs in Oregon and return <em>semantically altered man</em>. One could optimize the outputs through prompt engineering, translation chain length, masking probability tuning, etc. and generate more compelling lyrical variations than what I've demonstrated.</p>
<p>In any case, I found  I learned quite a bit about these models and the current API (including how to evade copyright violations).</p>
